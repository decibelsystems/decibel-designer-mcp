# Phase 2: Auto-Documentation Feature

## Summary
Implements automatic documentation generation for Figma design systems. The new `generate_documentation` tool creates comprehensive markdown docs from components and design tokens.

## Changes

### New Tool: generate_documentation
- Generates three types of markdown documentation:
  1. Design tokens organized by category
  2. Component library with full details
  3. Design system overview with statistics
- Flexible options to select which docs to generate
- Creates clean `/projects/{id}/documentation/` structure
- Professional markdown formatting with headers and code blocks

### Implementation Details
- Added helper functions for each doc type:
  - `generateTokensDoc()` - Tokens by category with values
  - `generateComponentsDoc()` - Components with descriptions
  - `generateOverviewDoc()` - System summary with links
- Uses existing `getFigmaData()` from Phase 1
- Handles both mock and API modes automatically
- Generates multiple files in single tool call

## Benefits
- Self-documenting design systems
- Always up-to-date reference docs
- Better developer onboarding
- Searchable markdown format
- Git-committable documentation

## Files Modified
- `src/tools/index.ts` - Added generate_documentation tool
- `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` - Completion documentation

## Testing
- ✅ Documentation generation working
- ✅ All three doc types created correctly
- ✅ Proper markdown formatting
- ✅ Token categorization accurate
- ✅ Component details complete
- ✅ Works in mock mode
- ✅ Compatible with Phase 1 caching

## Next Phase
Phase 3 will add component property extraction and variant analysis.
