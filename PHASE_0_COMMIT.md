# ðŸ“‹ Phase 0 Commit Summary

## âœ… Files to Commit (Clean, User-Friendly)

### New Figma Integration Files
- `src/store/figmaStore.ts` - Core Figma data layer
- `projects/demo/mocks/figma.json` - Sample mock data
- `projects/demo/cache/.gitkeep` - Cache directory marker
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

### Updated Files
- `src/resources/index.ts` - Added Figma resources
- `.gitignore` - Excluded cache directories and local dev scripts
- `package.json` - Version bump to 0.2.0
- `ROADMAP.md` - Updated with Figma integration phases

### Documentation
- `FIGMA_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete Figma integration guide
- `TESTING_PHASE_0.md` - Testing instructions
- `COMMIT_MESSAGE.md` - Suggested commit messages
- `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Generic dev workflow (no user-specific paths)
- `LOCAL_DEV_SCRIPTS.md` - Explains git-ignored scripts

## ðŸš« Files NOT Committed (Local Dev Tools)

These stay on your machine only:
- `sync-to-mcp.sh` - Your personal sync script
- `watch-sync.sh` - Your watch mode script
- `setup-dev.sh` - Your setup script
- `DEV_CHEATSHEET.md` - Your personal cheat sheet

## Why This is Good

**For other contributors:**
- Clean, professional repo
- Clear documentation
- No confusing user-specific scripts
- Easy to understand what's part of the MCP vs dev tooling

**For you:**
- Your workflow automation still works
- Scripts stay local, won't get overwritten on pull
- Can customize them without affecting the repo

## Next Steps

1. **Check what will be committed:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/decibel-designer-mcp
   git status
   ```

2. **Commit the Phase 0 work:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add Figma integration foundation (Phase 0)

   Implements mock-first Figma component and token system with MCP resources.
   
   - Add figma-components and figma-tokens MCP resources
   - Implement caching layer and component alias system
   - Create comprehensive mock data with 5 components + tokens
   - Version bump to 0.2.0
   
   See FIGMA_INTEGRATION.md for details"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **If using local sync scripts:**
   ```bash
   # Your local scripts (git-ignored) still work!
   ./sync-to-mcp.sh
   # or
   ./watch-sync.sh
   ```

## Verify It's Clean

```bash
# Show only files that will be committed (your sync scripts won't appear):
git status --short

# Show what's git-ignored:
git status --ignored
```

You should see your sync scripts in the "ignored" section, and the Figma integration files in the "to be committed" section.

**Result:** Clean public repo + working local dev automation! ðŸŽ‰
