# ðŸš¨ Important: Data Safety Update

## What Changed

Added critical data protection to prevent accidental loss of user projects during updates or syncs.

### Files Updated
- `.gitignore` - Now protects all user projects (only demo is committed)
- `DATA_SAFETY.md` - Complete guide on protecting user data
- Your local `sync-to-mcp.sh` - Fixed to only sync demo project

### The Issue You Caught

The original sync script had:
```bash
rsync -av --delete "$GIT_REPO/projects/" "$MCP_PROD/projects/"
```

That `--delete` flag could have **wiped out user projects**! ðŸ˜±

### The Fix

Now only the demo project syncs:
```bash
rsync -av "$GIT_REPO/projects/demo/" "$MCP_PROD/projects/demo/"
```

User projects are completely protected.

## Commit This

```bash
git add .gitignore DATA_SAFETY.md
git commit -m "feat: Add data safety protections for user projects

Prevents accidental deletion of user project data during updates.

- Update .gitignore to only commit demo project
- Add DATA_SAFETY.md documentation
- Clarify that user projects are local-only

BREAKING: None - this is a safety improvement
IMPACT: Positive - protects user data from accidental deletion"

git push origin main
```

## Your Local Sync Script

Your `sync-to-mcp.sh` is now safe and will:
âœ… Only update the demo project  
âœ… Preserve all your real project data  
âœ… Never delete user projects

---

**Great catch on this!** This could have caused real data loss for users. ðŸŽ‰
